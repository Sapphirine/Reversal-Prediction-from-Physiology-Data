Reversal Prediction from Physiology Data

We implemented the physiological activity prediction with linear conditional random fields

The Python library we used is Pystruct, a machine learning class with conditional random fields models. This library can be installed by entering "pip install pystruct" in terminal on mac, with pre-installed cvxopt, cython and scikit-learn.
